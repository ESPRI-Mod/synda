Requirement
    The following parameters must be set in SDT configuration file (sdt.conf)
    before running this test:
        indexes=esgf-data.dkrz.de
        default_index=esgf-data.dkrz.de
Notes
    - When run, this test makes some changes in the Synda configuration that you
      may want to revert once the test is done. Changes in SDT configuration file
      (sdt.conf) concern 'download' and 'post_processing' parameters. Changes in
      SDP configuration file (sdp.conf) concern 'pipeline_path' and
      'eventthread' parameters.
    - To test external scripts (not done currently), edit 'worker' script and
      replace '/opt/synda-ipsl/scripts_pp' with '$uat_t3/resource/scripts_pp' in
      'script_dir' parameter.
