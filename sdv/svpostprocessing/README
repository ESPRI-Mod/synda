Requirement
    The following parameters must be set in SDT configuration file (sdt.conf)
    before running this test:
        indexes=esgf-data.dkrz.de
        default_index=esgf-data.dkrz.de
Note
    When run, this test makes some changes in the Synda configuration that you
    may want to revert once the test is done. Changes in SDT configuration file
    (sdt.conf) concern 'download' and 'post_processing' parameters. Changes in
    SDP configuration file (sdp.conf) concern 'pipeline_path' and
    'eventthread' parameters.
