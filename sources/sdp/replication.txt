Synda installation
******************

We highly recommend to install Synda modules on a dedicated virtual machine using :ref:`RPM <rpm-install-sdt>` or :ref:`DEB <deb-install-sdt>` packages. This machine will be called *synda-host* in the following.

First, see Synda installation from :ref:`RPM package <rpm-install-sdt>` or :ref:`DEB package <deb-install-sdt>`.
Then, install Synda post-processing module from :ref:`RPM package <rpm-install-sdp>` or :ref:`DEB package <deb-install-sdp>`.

.. note::

    Synda needs to be installed as ``root`` on *synda-host*. Nevertheless, it can be run with a normal user which is belonging to the ``synda`` Unix group.

.. note::

    The ``synda`` Unix group has to be declared by your system administrator prior to the installation.
    All user id that are ``synda`` members will be able to run any ``synda [...]`` command.

Synda configuration
*******************

``sdt`` module
--------------

On *synda-host*:

- Set ``post_processing`` parameter to ``true`` in ``sdt.conf``.
- Set ``http_fallback`` parameter to ``true`` in ``sdt.conf``.
- Set ``check_parameter`` parameter to 0 in ``sdt.conf`` to allow Synda discovery on another index node than those specified in ``[index]`` section.
- Check the ``host`` parameter is the *synda-host* IP in ``sdt.conf``.

.. code-block:: text

    [module]
    post_processing=true
    ...
    [download]
    http_fallback=true
    ...
    [behaviour]
    check_parameter=0
    ...
    [post_processing]
    host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx
    port=18290

- Choose a password to configure RPC server in ``credentials.conf``.
- Check the ESGF ``openid`` and ``password`` are valid in ``credentials.conf`` and register to appropriate ESGF groups.

.. code-block:: text

    [post_processing]
    username=sdpp
    password=xxxxxx
    ...
    [esgf_credential]
    openid=https://my.data.node/esgf-idp/openid/synda
    password=xxxxxxx

- If do not exist, add the following constants into `/usr/share/python/synda/sdt/bin/sdconst.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    EVENT_FILE_COMPLETE='file_complete'
    EVENT_VARIABLE_COMPLETE='variable_complete'
    EVENT_DATASET_COMPLETE='dataset_complete'
    EVENT_DATASET_LATEST='dataset_latest'
    EVENT_LATEST_DATASET_COMPLETE='latest_dataset_complete'

-

``sdp`` module
--------------

On *synda-host*:

- Set ``eventhread`` parameter to ``1`` in ``sdp.conf``.
- Check the ``host`` parameter is the *synda-host* IP in ``sdt.conf``.

.. code-block:: text

    [daemon]
    eventthread=1
    host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx
    ...

- Copy the ``username`` and ``password`` in ``credentials.conf`` for RPC server from ``sdt`` configuration.

.. code-block:: text

    [rpcserver]
    username=sdpp
    password=xxxxxx

- If do not exist, add the following constants in `/usr/share/python/synda/sdp/bin/spconst.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    EVENT_FILE_COMPLETE='file_complete'
    EVENT_VARIABLE_COMPLETE='variable_complete'
    EVENT_DATASET_COMPLETE='dataset_complete'
    EVENT_DATASET_LATEST='dataset_latest'
    EVENT_LATEST_DATASET_COMPLETE='latest_dataset_complete'

- Add the project name you want to replicate to the `AUTHORIZED_PROJECT` list in `/usr/share/python/synda/sdp/bin/spconst.py`.

- Depending on its *Data Reference Syntax*, add the project name you want to replicate to the `PROJECT_WITH_ONE_VARIABLE_PER_DATASET` list in `/usr/share/python/synda/sdp/bin/spconst.py`.

``sdw`` module
--------------

This is the client side post-processing module (aka "worker"). This single Python script is fully independent from the Synda stack and can be run remotely or not from *synda-host*.
We will call *worker-host* the remote machine where the worker executes your scripts. *synda-host* and *worker-host* has to be accessible by the network each other without firewall constraints, etc.

For instance, in the replication context, the Synda worker could be run on the ESGF data node used to publish the replicated data.

.. note::

    The worker is installed with ``synda-pp`` and can be found in `/usr/bin/synda_wo` on *synda-host*. As a standalone script, the worker can be move or copy outside of *synda-host*. You will only need to install the following required Python librairies (see also the file header):
     - pip install python-daemon==1.6.1
     - pip install python-jsonrpc==0.8.4
     - pip install simplejson==3.10.0
     - pip install retrying

.. warning::

    In the context of the ESGF Replication Working Team, an up-to-date version of the worker is available here: :download:`synda_wo <synda_wo>`.

Target data to replicate
------------------------

Edit one or several selection file focusing the data you want to replicate. See :ref:`the selection file section <selection-file>`.

.. note::

    You can create many selection files (e.g. one per project). Selection file(s) must be stored in the "selection" folder.

Copy those selection files on *synda-host* into the selection folder. This folder is ``/etc/synda/sdt/selection`` by default or can be defined in ``/etc/synda/sdt/sdt.conf`` with the ``selection_path`` parameter. See :ref:`the synda configuration section <config-param-ref-sdt>`

.. warning::

    Use the ``searchapi_host`` selection file parameter to allow Synda to discover files on another index node than those specified in the ``/etc/synda/sdt/sdt.conf``.
    Be careful to disable the facet checking in ``/etc/synda/sdt/sdt.conf`` using ``check_parameter=0``.

.. warning::

    Pay attention to any conflict with the default selection parameters that overwrite the selection file parameters.
    Default parameters are defined into specific templates in the default folder on *synda-host*.
    This folder is ``/etc/synda/sdt/default`` by default but can be defined in the synda configuration file using the ``default_path`` parameter. See :ref:`the synda configuration section <config-param-ref-sdt>`.

Build a republication pipeline
------------------------------

This republication pipeline is at least composed of 2 tasks to apply on each replicated dataset:
 - The mapfile generation,
 - The ESGF publication as replicas.

Pipeline definition
+++++++++++++++++++

On *synda-host*:

- Edit the file ``/etc/synda/sdp/pipeline/republication.py``. This file content must be:

.. code-block:: python

    import sppostprocessingutils

    def get_pipeline():
        return ppp

    # Piepline name
    name='republication'

    # Transitions/tasks list
    tasks=['mapfile','publication']

    ppp = sppostprocessingutils.build_light_pipeline(name, tasks)


- Edit the file ``/etc/synda/sdp/pipeline/spbindings.py``. This file content must be:

.. code-block:: python

    import spconst

    # Mapping: a 'key' event into the corresponding tuple of 'value' pipeline with starting 'status'
    event_pipeline_mapping = {
        spconst.EVENT_VARIABLE_COMPLETE: ('republication', spconst.PPPRUN_STATUS_WAITING)
    }

.. note::

    You can easily manage your pipeline definitions in another folder by using the ``pipeline_path`` parameter in ``sdp.conf``. See :ref:`the synda configuration section <config-param-ref-sdp>`.

Scripts
+++++++

A transition name has to be the same as the script you want to apply as post-process.
Due to the RPC server connexion, those scripts can be run outside of *synda-host*. See the worker configuration below. This is very useful for intensive computing process that requires cluster infrastructure.

.. warning::

    Whether your scripts are run remotely or not, all the required dependencies, libraries, compiler, etc. have to be installed on *synda-host* or *worker-host*.

- Edit :download:`mapfile.sh <mapfile.sh>` that will generate mapfiles using the ```esgprep mapfile`` command-line <http://is-enes-data.github.io/esgf-prepare/>`_.

- Edit and configure :download:`publication.sh <publication.sh>` that will publish the generated mapfile as replica. The script content should like:

Each script as two main section:

 - The initialization section deserializes the command-line argument submitted by the worker to the script.
 - The main section apply the processing.

.. warning:

    The provided templates works with some functions to source with :download:`functions.sh <functions.sh>`.

File discovery
**************

Install your selection file on *synda-host*:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda install -s <selection-file>

Or upgrade the file discovery:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda upgrade

At this point, files metadata are stored in local database and data download can begin.

Files download
**************

To start the download, run command below on *synda-host*:

.. code-block:: bash

    service sdt start

At this point, the downloading is in progress and when a dataset is complete an event is create to trigger the corresponding pipeline creation.

Files processing
****************

To start the post-processing, run command below on *synda-host*:

.. code-block:: bash

    service sdp start

At this point, the downloading is in progress and the previous event are consumed by ``sdp`` to create appropriate pipeline entries into the database.
The first transition of each complete dataset has a "waiting" status.

Then, run the worker remotely (i.e., on *worker-host*) or not (i.e., on *synda-host*):

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts

At this point, the worker communicates with the ``sdp`` database to pick up information on a dataset pending for a transition to apply.
The worker run the corresponding script and returns the job result to ``sdp``. On success, the transition is set to "done" and replaced by the next one.

The worker can be run as a daemon using the ``start``, ``stop`` and ``status`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo start -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts

The worker allows you to:

- Pick up only one item to process from ``sdp``:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts -1

- Filter the transitions to process:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts -j mapfile

- Filter the pipeline to process:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts -p republication

By default, the worker log is ``/var/log/sdw/worker.log```on *synda-host*  and ``/tmp`` on *worker-host*. On *worker-host* you can submit another log directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    synda_wo -H <synda-host-IP> -w <rpc-password> --script_dir /your/scripts -l /your/logs

.. note::

    All those examples can be combined safely.
